- **Rollback Procedures**: Documented rollback and recovery procedures

**Migration Guide Red Flags**:
- **Outdated Information**: Guides for deprecated migration paths
- **Incomplete Steps**: Missing critical migration steps or validation
- **Untested Procedures**: Migration steps without validation or testing
- **Community-Only Sources**: Non-official guides without authoritative validation

## Information Documentation Standards
### Required Migration Research Documentation
1. **Official Guide URLs**: Complete URLs to all official migration documentation sources
2. **Version Specificity**: Exact source and target versions with migration path validation
3. **Migration Steps**: Detailed step-by-step migration procedures and validation
4. **Tool Documentation**: Migration tool requirements and usage documentation
5. **Risk Assessment**: Migration risks, rollback procedures, and contingency planning
