### MySQL to PostgreSQL Migration Expertise
#### Data Type Mapping and Schema Conversion
```sql
-- Critical Data Type Conversions
-- MySQL AUTO_INCREMENT -> PostgreSQL SERIAL
CREATE TABLE booking (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,  -- Was AUTO_INCREMENT
    customer_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    booking_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);

-- MySQL ENUM -> PostgreSQL CHECK Constraints
-- MySQL: status ENUM('pending', 'confirmed', 'cancelled')
-- PostgreSQL: 
ALTER TABLE booking 
ADD CONSTRAINT status_check 
CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'confirmed', 'cancelled'));

-- MySQL VARCHAR without limit -> PostgreSQL TEXT or VARCHAR with limit
-- MySQL: description VARCHAR  
-- PostgreSQL: description TEXT (preferred) or description VARCHAR(1000)
```

#### Function and Syntax Migration
```sql
-- MySQL Functions -> PostgreSQL Equivalents
-- MySQL: NOW() -> PostgreSQL: CURRENT_TIMESTAMP or NOW()
-- MySQL: STR_TO_DATE() -> PostgreSQL: TO_DATE()
-- MySQL: CONCAT_WS() -> PostgreSQL: CONCAT() with COALESCE()
-- MySQL: GROUP_CONCAT() -> PostgreSQL: STRING_AGG()

-- Example: Analytics query conversion
-- MySQL Version:
SELECT 
    DATE_FORMAT(booking_date, '%Y-%m') as month,
    COUNT(*) as bookings,
    GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT customer_name) as customers
FROM bookings 
WHERE booking_date >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 6 MONTH)
GROUP BY DATE_FORMAT(booking_date, '%Y-%m');

-- PostgreSQL Version:
SELECT 
    TO_CHAR(booking_date, 'YYYY-MM') as month,
    COUNT(*) as bookings,
    STRING_AGG(DISTINCT customer_name, ', ') as customers
FROM bookings 
WHERE booking_date >= CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '6 months'
GROUP BY TO_CHAR(booking_date, 'YYYY-MM');
```

### Azure PostgreSQL Migration Strategy
#### Migration Tool Selection Matrix
```markdown
# Migration Tool Decision Framework

**pgLoader** - Best for:
- Large bulk data transfers (up to 3TB/hour)
- Automatic data type conversion
- Complex data transformations
- Initial data loading phase

**Azure Database Migration Service** - Best for:
- Online migrations with minimal downtime
- Continuous data replication
- Schema and data migration combined
- Azure-integrated validation

**pg_dump/pg_restore** - Best for:
- Complex database objects (views, functions, triggers)
- Schema-only migrations
- Precise control over migration process
- Secondary object creation

**Hybrid Approach** - Recommended for Old School Travel:
1. pgLoader for bulk data transfer
2. Azure DMS for ongoing replication
3. pg_dump for complex objects
4. Manual validation for critical business logic
```
