## PostgreSQL Troubleshooting Tools (2025)
### Essential Diagnostic Commands
- **Connection Testing**: `psql -h hostname -U username -d database -c "SELECT version();"`
- **Activity Monitoring**: `SELECT pid, usename, application_name, state, query_start FROM pg_stat_activity;`
- **Lock Analysis**: `SELECT * FROM pg_locks WHERE NOT granted;`
- **Blocking Detection**: `SELECT pg_blocking_pids(pid) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE wait_event IS NOT NULL;`

### Performance Analysis Tools
- **Query Performance**: `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) SELECT * FROM table_name;`
- **Statistics Collection**: `SELECT * FROM pg_stat_statements ORDER BY total_exec_time DESC;`
- **Index Usage**: `SELECT schemaname, tablename, indexname, idx_scan FROM pg_stat_user_indexes;`
- **Table Statistics**: `SELECT schemaname, tablename, n_tup_ins, n_tup_upd, n_tup_del FROM pg_stat_user_tables;`

### Advanced Monitoring (PostgreSQL 16+ Features)
- **Progress Monitoring**: `SELECT * FROM pg_stat_progress_analyze;`
- **VACUUM Progress**: `SELECT * FROM pg_stat_progress_vacuum;`
- **Index Creation**: `SELECT * FROM pg_stat_progress_create_index;`
- **Replication Status**: `SELECT * FROM pg_stat_replication;`

### Log Analysis and Configuration
